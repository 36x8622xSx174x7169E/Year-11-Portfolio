      <h2>1.Body Proportion Sketch</h2>
      <h3>Development</h3>




      <p>I used a 8 head proportional guide to draw my game character on, this means that the body parts are all the correct size in comparison 
        to each other. I drew a side and front view of the character before scanning the final drawing and importing this into blender. My
        game character is modeled to be adventurous with a hood and a shoulderpad. After importing my drawing scans into blender I started building the 
        character model starting with the torso then moving on to the arms,legs and then head. After this i did some basic detailing to give the character
        a hood, if I had had more time i would have loved to learn and incorperate some cloth simulaitons for a cloak and some of the clothing but i had to make do.
        After the basic modeling I moved onto animating first I started off by building the armature and parenting everything to the spine before linking each bone to the corresponding body part 
        I started off with a default pose before moving onto an idle animation, this was the character bobbing up and down
        and the arms moving out and in. Later I started with the run animation this took me  a while as i ended up reding the bones in the leg to fix a problem i was having
        to do this i watched an online totorial. I finished off by expanding on the running animation and adding a celebratory jump/pose at the end.

      <h2>2. Task Two</h2>
      <h3> Testing</h3>



      <p>I tested my animation muiltiple times during and after I made it. I made sure that the loop was clean and there were no sudden movements or unintended
        movements. I ended up testing the legs over 30 times duting the animation prosess due to a reoccuring issue where they were bending outwards
        to fix this i changed the bone structure in the legs'(ilater found out that this could be fixed by moving the knee joint closer towards the fromt of the knee)'.  
        I also tested muiltiple different bone configurations in the arm including  a modified version of that of the legs. In the end i stayed with the original
        as it provided the largest variety of movement needed. After rigourous testing i got to a point to where my animation looked good enough however i was
        unable to fix the issue which caused the animation to look floaty.

      <h2>3. Task Three</h2>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>




      <p>My Main feedback was from Robert, Charlie and my teacher Rachael
        The main feedback was about the legs of my character being too short, and that my character should be semeterical for easy mirroring 
        and rigging. I fixed both of these issues.

      <h2>4. Task Four</h2>
      <h3> Improvements</h3>
      

      <p>I mad several improvements to the character and animation and pre sketch, during the design prosess i made the legs longer and
        removed the prosthetic arm i had planned to simplify the later desighn steps and allow for mirroring i also had to fix the topology around the anke 
      to as good as i could get it but the mesh is now solid. Later in the animatioon faze i changed the bone structue and redid the arms and legs in the 
    running animation to make the movement more fluid, before this only the lower arm would move leading to a chopping motion but I fixed it.  </p>
