      <h2>1.Character Turnaround</h2>
      <h3>Development</h3>




      <p>I used a character head reference to create my character turnaround I chose to make my character 8 heads tall so that it was at the adult reference
        height then I drew a center line and modeled my font and side view around it to make sure it was symeterical. </p>

      <img class="place" src="turnaround (3).jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 350px;height:300px;">
      <br>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>I checked my characters symetry and that it was centered on the line, I checked that the scale of my side view compared to my fromt view were the same so that
        that it would match up and create a propper and reliable reference when I imported it into blender.
      </p>
  
      <hr class="slime" />

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>Are there any obvios issues with my character turnaround?</p>
      <br>
      <p>"Its a bit wide abross the chest"-Robert</p>
      <br>
      <p>"Waist is too thin"-Charlie</p>
      <br>
      <p>"Upper body proportions are too big , Try making the legs larger and taller"-Kit</p>

      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>I revisited the scale of the upper body and shrunk the upper chest and slightly enlarged the waist.
        I also moves the waist up and lengthened the legs. I later removes the characters original prosthetic arm and
        replaced it with a normal arm so it was symeterical for easy modeling.

      <h2>2. Torso</h2>
      <h3> Development</h3>


      
      
       
       
      
      <p>I started with a cube and then opp cut it and removed the verticies on the left side, 
        I then mirrored it so that my torso would be symeterical.</p>

        <br>
    
        <p> I then loop cut the cube and moved the verticies so that they resembled a torso i used my turnaround references to get the scale right.</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>My Main feedback was from Robert, Charlie and my teacher Rachael
        The main feedback was about the legs of my character being too short, and that my character should be
        semeterical for easy mirroring
        and rigging. I fixed both of these issues.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr class = "slime"/>
      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>I removed the prosthetic arm that my character had to make it symeterical and lenthened the legs, I also remeshed my characters feet as some of the 
        verticies were inverted and misplaced the remeshing wasn't perfect but it is bettan than it was.
      </p>

        <h2>3.Animation</h2>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I started by creating a skeleton for my creature and joining parenting everything to the spine I also joing each body part to the corresponding bone
          then i created an idle, running and default animation.

        </p>
        <br class ="slime"/>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p> I ran the animation over and over to make sure that ther was no clipping or bones bending the wrong way</p>
        <hr class = "slime"/>
        <br>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>Robert- "Animation is a bit shaky"
          Charlie-"Your legs rotate outward when it crouches down"
        </p>
        <hr class = "slime"/>
        <br>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <p>I mad several improvements to the character and animation and pre sketch, during the design prosess i made the
          legs longer and
          removed the prosthetic arm i had planned to simplify the later desighn steps and allow for mirroring i also had
          to fix the topology around the anke
          to as good as i could get it but the mesh is now solid. Later in the animatioon faze i changed the bone structue
          and redid the arms and legs in the
          running animation to make the movement more fluid, before this only the lower arm would move leading to a
          chopping motion but I fixed it. </p>
