      <h2>1.Planning/Orginisation</h2>
      <h3>Development</h3>




      <p>I used our group planning slides to create a project page showing all of things that need to do, inp progress and also what has been finished it also
        showed the priority of the different tasks. I also created a flowchart to help plan the story and the different story options.  </p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>This did not require much testing i just mainly checked that the plan was doable and that we could achieve it in the appointed time.
        I also found an issue where i could not share the project page with my team (this issue has still not been resolved)

      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>Robert ended up changing a few things(after story was writin and shared with group) so that the story had more paths (these were only minor changes)

      <h2>2.Story</h2>
      <h3> Development</h3>


      
      
       
       
      
      <p>I used the flowchart i had created to structure the story, i structured the story so that it would be easy for robert to incorpperate it into the main code
        i made sure to also inclue notes about what happens to the code in certain parts of the story. The original plan was for the story sections to be short but 
        i decided that it would be better to use more detail to engage the user more.

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I made sure to read through the story a couple of times to make sure that it was correct and that the story events were as they were supposed to be
        during this prosess i used my flowchart as a reference to check the story against.

        <h2>3.Main Code</h2>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I used the path and x variables in the code robert created to check where the code is and then used the values in my code. This code works by checking 
          the health value and if the health is less than 0 the character will die. I chose where the chackpoints were placed by checking the path and x values.
          I also created the companion code this code gives you an option to chose your companion between 2 options then saves your choise and allows you to name it
          the main purpose of this code though is to torment the user as later on you are told to eat your pet that you have bonded with.

        </p>
        <br class ="slime"/>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p> I played the game a couple of times to check that the correct checkpoint was being used when the character dies.
          For the companion system we had to check that the system was actually letting the user choose what they wanted to have and we also had to check That
          the consume and inventory funcions were working.

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>Robert- "This is great"
          Charlie-"A bit dark"
          Oisin-"Looks fine"
        </p>
        <hr class = "slime"/>
        <br>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <p>We had to change the remdomise code so that it picked between the values of 0,1 as the previouse code was not working. We also changed the checkpoint system so that it worked with the new code That
          Oisin had made.
        </p>
