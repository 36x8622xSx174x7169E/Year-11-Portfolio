      <br>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>I checked my characters symetry and that it was centered on the line, I checked that the scale of my side view compared to my fromt view were the same so that
        that it would match up and create a propper and reliable reference when I imported it into blender.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>Are there any obvios issues with my character turnaround?</p>

      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>I revisited the scale of the upper body and shrunk the upper chest and slightly enlarged the waist.
        I also moves the waist up and lengthened the legs. I later removes the characters original prosthetic arm and
        replaced it with a normal arm so it was symeterical for easy modeling.

      <h3> Development</h3>


      
      
       
       
      
      <p>I started with a cube and then opp cut it and removed the verticies on the left side, 
        I then mirrored it so that my torso would be symeterical.</p>
        <img class="place" src="Startoftorso.png" alt="placeholder"style="width:350px;height:300px;">
        <br>
    
        <p> I then loop cut the cube and moved the verticies so that they resembled a torso i used my turnaround references to get the scale right.</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>My Main feedback was from Robert, Charlie and my teacher Rachael
        The main feedback was about the legs of my character being too short, and that my character should be
        semeterical for easy mirroring
        and rigging. I fixed both of these issues.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr class = "slime"/>
      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>I removed the prosthetic arm that my character had to make it symeterical and lenthened the legs, I also remeshed my characters feet as some of the 
        verticies were inverted and misplaced the remeshing wasn't perfect but it is bettan than it was.

        <h2>3.Main Code</h2>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I used the path and x variables in the code robert created to check where the code is and then used the values in my code. This code works by checking 
          the health value and if the health is less than 0 the character will die. I chose where the chackpoints were placed by checking the path and x values.

        </p>
        <br class ="slime"/>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p> I played the game a couple of times to check that the correct checkpoint was being used when the character dies.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>Robert- "I Think It's Good, I Like The Way that It Works"
          Charlie-"I Liked The Checkpoint System But i Think that it could be better at telleng you when a checkpoint is saved"
          Oisin-"I Think That I Works Functionally"
        </p>
        <hr class = "slime"/>
        <br>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <p>I changed the system so that when you pass a checkpoint it prints a message telling you that you have passes a checkpoint, i have also changed the 
          path and x funcions as Oisin's code will sove an error that we have been having. </p>
